The aim of this project was to see if there is any relationship between the unemployment rate and education level. The data used was taken from the 
Integrated Public Use Microdata series. There were some restrictions used to create important variables. The best way to make those is by changing them into dummmy
variables. This changes data from categorical to quantitative binomial variables. Usually, the variable can have two values, 1 or 0. 1 indicates the variable's
effect is present in the data. It is 0 if there is no effect. The data sample used was to only include anyone who was in the labor force between February and May of
2020. The other important variable was used to only have anyone who has an education obtainment from high school to a doctorate degree. The model used to perform the 
analysis is the linear regression model. This model uses a dependent variable on the left hand side. One or more independent right hand side variables are also used. 
The final step is to print the results.
