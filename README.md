The inflation project's purpose was to estimate the CPI inflation rate in the first quarter of 2022. The numbers used were found on the Federal Reserve of Economic Data. There was a year restriction, to only include from the year 1980 to 2021 in the data itself. The most important factor is the data used is measured in personal income expenses. The regression is combined with the data to find the CHANGE in personal income expenses. The way to estimate inflation was a linear regression model. A linear regression takes a left hand (dependent) variable and one or more right hand (independent) variable(s). 
Education and emloyment measured how the covid pandemic affected employment. Two different groups were used: people who have a college degree and people who don't. This assignment's data was found on the  Integrated Public Use Microdata! (IPUMS). The main restriction in the data was to allow have people in the labor force between February and May 2020. The most importat part was making an interaction variable so the sample can include the education and the labor force variables joined together. A linear regression model was used, where one or more right hand side variables are way to measure how a left hand side variable changes.
