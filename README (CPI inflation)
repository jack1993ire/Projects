The objective of the CPI inflation assignmment was to estimate the inflation rate in the first quarter of 2022. The data for the assignment was taken from the Federal 
Reserve Economic Data. The data sample used quarterly Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE). I had to create another variable, Change in Personal Consumption 
Expenditures. Several lag variables were included. A lag is used to predict a value based on previous values. It had to be used because the data taken from FRED is time 
series data, data that changes over a certain time interval. There were no other variables used. The regression model used was a linear regression, where is one left hand 
side dependent variable and one or more right hand side independent variables.
